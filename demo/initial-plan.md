The Story Arc (Left Screen) → App Response (Right Screen)
COLD OPEN (0:00–0:12)

Left: Black screen. White text fades in: "8 million Schengen visa applications per year. 1 in 5 rejected." Then: "Most rejections are preventable."
Right: Black screen. Nothing yet.
Left: Text fades to "This is Priya."
Right: Still black. Tension builds.

ACT 1 — The Problem (0:12–0:40)

Left: Kling-generated clip of Priya (Indian woman, early 30s, professional) at her desk surrounded by documents. She looks stressed, flipping through papers. Maybe a close-up of her hands organizing a passport, printed bank statements, an invitation letter.
Right: Traverse landing page loads. The stats appear: "37,830+ corridors. 100+ languages." Voiceover: "Priya is a software engineer in Mumbai, attending her first tech conference in Munich. She's never applied for a Schengen visa."
Left: Priya looking at her laptop, overwhelmed. Maybe a shot of a Google search showing confusing visa requirement pages.
Right: Persona sidebar opens. Priya's profile loads — India → Germany, Business, March 2026. "Load Profile" clicked. The form auto-fills. Voiceover: "She has nine documents. Some in Hindi, some in English. She doesn't know if they're enough — or if they contradict each other."

ACT 2 — The Research (0:40–1:10)

Left: Priya waiting anxiously. Maybe looking at her phone, checking the time. A shot of a calendar showing "Conference: March 13-15."
Right: "Check Requirements" clicked. Analysis page loads. Research Agent activates — the SSE stream starts, thinking panel shows real Opus 4.6 reasoning, requirements populate progressively. Sources appear with clickable links. Voiceover: "Traverse's Research Agent searches live government sources — the German Embassy, VFS Global — building a personalized checklist for Priya's exact corridor."
Left: Quick cut — Priya looking hopeful, leaning toward her screen.
Right: Requirements fully loaded. Preliminary advisory card appears instantly. Voiceover: "Before she uploads a single document, Traverse already knows what she needs."

ACT 3 — The Discovery (1:10–1:55)
This is your money section. This is where you win or lose.

Left: Priya uploading documents to her laptop. Close-up of her hands. She looks confident — she thinks everything is in order.
Right: Passport dropped on first requirement. Then second document dropped — remaining 7 auto-upload with the cascade effect. Voiceover: "Priya uploads her documents. Watch what happens."
Right: Documents analyzing in parallel. Progress bar moving. Advisory card updating in real-time as each document completes. Then — the cross-lingual contradiction fires. The requirement turns red/warning.
Left: Priya's expression shifts. She doesn't know it yet, but her documents have a problem.
Right: Zoom in (Screen Studio) on the contradiction: employment letter says "permanent employee, ₹85,000/month" in Hindi. Cover letter says "contract consultant, ₹60,000/month" in English. Voiceover: "Her employment letter — written in Hindi — says permanent employee at 85,000 rupees. Her cover letter — in English — says contract consultant at 60,000. Opus 4.6 reads both languages, reasons through the contradiction, and flags it. An embassy officer would catch this. Traverse catches it first."
Left: Priya looking worried now. Close-up of her face.
Right: Phase 2 advisory refinement kicks in. Loading indicator. Then the advisory modal opens — "Let's Strengthen Your Application." Must Fix These First section with the contradiction highlighted, specific fix instructions, Bajaj Allianz URL for the insurance issue. Voiceover: "Three AI agents. Prioritized fixes. Specific next steps. In any language."

ACT 4 — The Resolution (1:55–2:30)

Left: Priya smiling, looking relieved. Maybe a shot of her at a desk, on the phone (calling Bajaj Allianz to fix the insurance). Then a shot of her looking confident, documents neatly organized.
Right: Quick flash of switching language to Hindi — the entire interface translates with fade animations. Then quick cuts of Amara (Nigeria → UK) and Carlos (Brazil → Japan) persona cards loading. Voiceover: "Any corridor. Any language. From Mumbai to Munich, Lagos to London, São Paulo to Tokyo."
Left: Priya at an airport gate, smiling, holding her passport and boarding pass. The emotional payoff.
Right: The Traverse landing page with the tagline.

CLOSE (2:30–2:50)

Left + Right merge to full screen: Clean title card. "Traverse. Three AI agents that review your visa application like an experienced immigration team." Then: "Built with Claude Opus 4.6. Open source." GitHub link. Fade to black.


Production Plan — Tools & Timeline:
Video generation (Kling AI) — 2-3 hours:
You need about 6-8 short clips (5-10 seconds each). Generate these prompts:

"Indian woman in her early 30s, professional attire, sitting at a desk covered with documents and passport, looking stressed, warm indoor lighting, cinematic"
"Close-up of hands flipping through passport pages and printed bank statements on a desk"
"Indian woman looking at laptop screen with worried expression, soft focus background"
"Indian woman leaning toward laptop screen, hopeful expression, warm lighting"
"Indian woman's face shifting from confidence to concern, close-up, cinematic"
"Indian woman smiling while talking on phone at desk, documents organized neatly, warm lighting"
"Indian woman at airport gate, smiling, holding passport and boarding pass, natural lighting, cinematic"
"Close-up of calendar showing dates March 13-15 circled, desk background" (this one you might just make as a graphic instead)

Generate each as 5-second clips. If a generation doesn't look right, regenerate — don't spend more than 3 attempts per clip. Quality matters more than quantity; cut any clip that looks uncanny.
Screen recording (Screen Studio) — 1-2 hours:
Do one clean run-through of the Priya flow. Screen Studio's auto-zoom on clicks will make it look polished without effort. Record at the highest resolution your screen supports. Make sure you're in light mode (Blueberry & Ink) — it reads better on video than dark mode for a professional demo. Run the full flow once before recording to make sure everything works smoothly.
Voiceover (ElevenLabs) — 30 min:
Write the script first (I've basically drafted it above). Paste the full narration into ElevenLabs. Pick a warm, clear, authoritative voice — not robotic, not overly dramatic. Something like "Rachel" or "Adam" in their library. Generate, download. Should be under 3 minutes total narration.
Editing (CapCut) — 2-3 hours:
This is where the split-screen comes together. CapCut has a split-screen template or you can manually position two tracks side by side. Place the Kling clips on the left track, Screen Studio recording on the right track, ElevenLabs voiceover as the audio track. Add text overlays for the opening stats and the closing title card. Speed up wait times on the right side (document analysis, advisory loading). Add a subtle background music track (CapCut has royalty-free options — something ambient and hopeful, not dramatic).
You mentioned Boomshare.ai — I'm not familiar with it specifically. If it handles split-screen composition natively, use it. But CapCut can definitely do split-screen editing and it's free, so have that as a backup.
Total production time: 6-8 hours. That's tight but doable if you start tomorrow morning with the Kling generations running while you do the screen recording.

One critical note on the narrative:
The story arc I've outlined treats Priya as a real person with a real problem. That's what makes it work — the judge isn't watching a tool demo, they're watching someone's life get easier. But the emotional beats need to be earned, not forced. The key moment is the contradiction detection at 1:30 — when the left screen shows Priya looking confident (she thinks her documents are fine) and the right screen shows the system catching something she'd never have caught herself. That juxtaposition is your "genuinely cool to watch" moment. Everything in the video should build toward it and pay off from it.
Don't let the AI video clips distract from the app. The left screen supports the right screen, not the other way around. If any Kling clip looks even slightly off, cut it and use a simple text card or a still image instead. A beautiful app demo with one bad AI video clip is worse than a beautiful app demo with no AI video at all.

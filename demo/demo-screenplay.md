### KLING AI PROMPTS

**Clip 1** — Priya at desk (5s)
```
Cinematic medium shot of an Indian woman in her early 30s, professional 
attire (navy blazer, small earrings), sitting at a clean desk with a 
laptop open, passport, and small stack of printed documents. She's 
reading a document with a slightly worried expression. Warm indoor 
lighting, shallow depth of field, office setting with a window showing 
city lights. Subtle movement — she shifts the document closer. Film 
grain, 24fps cinematic look.
```

**Clip 2** — Hands on documents (5s)
```
Close-up of feminine hands with neat nails flipping through a dark blue 
Indian passport, with bank statements and an official letter visible on 
the desk beside it. Some documents have Hindi text visible. The hands 
pause on a specific page. Warm desk lamp lighting, shallow depth of 
field, cinematic color grade. Slow, deliberate movement.
```

**Clip 3** — Priya at laptop, stressed (5s)
```
Medium close-up of an Indian woman in her early 30s looking at a laptop 
screen with a concerned expression. She's resting her chin on her hand. 
The laptop screen casts a soft glow on her face. Background slightly 
blurred — bookshelf, framed photo. She sighs subtly. Warm indoor 
lighting, cinematic shallow DOF, film grain.
```

## SECTION 2 — THE RESEARCH (0:30–1:00)

### LEFT SCREEN
**[KLING CLIP 4 — 5s]** Calendar close-up showing "ESAS Conference: March 13–15"
**[KLING CLIP 3 — reuse last 3s]** Priya waiting
**[TRANSITION to full right screen for 10s to show the app working]**

### RIGHT SCREEN
- **0:30** — Mouse clicks "Check Requirements." Page navigates to `/analyze`.
- **0:33** — Corridor card loads: India 🇮🇳 → Germany 🇩🇪. Multi-language greeting appears (English, Hindi, German).
- **0:36** — Research Agent activates. Phase stepper shows "Research" active. Live feed streams thinking: *"Searching for business visa requirements: India → Germany..."*
- **0:40** — Sources appear one by one: German Federal Foreign Office, VFS Global India. Green checkmarks.
- **0:44** — Requirements populate progressively — passport validity, bank statements, employment proof, cover letter, business invitation, travel insurance, flight booking, accommodation proof. Each slides in with a subtle animation.
- **0:50** — Research complete. Phase stepper advances. Requirements checklist fully loaded with 8–9 items.
- **0:54** — Preliminary advisory card appears instantly below: "We've identified your requirements. Upload documents to verify."

### VOICEOVER
> *"Traverse's Research Agent searches live government sources — the German Federal Foreign Office, VFS Global — and builds a personalized checklist for Priya's exact corridor. Before she uploads a single document, it already knows what she needs."*

### KLING AI PROMPTS

**Clip 4** — Calendar (5s)
```
Close-up of a desk calendar or planner showing the month of March 2026. 
The dates March 13, 14, 15 are circled in blue pen with "ESAS Berlin" 
written next to them. A pen rests on the page. Warm desk lamp lighting, 
shallow depth of field, slight camera push-in. Clean, modern desk 
surface visible.
```

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- This section goes mostly full-right-screen to showcase the app
- Speed up any pauses in the SSE stream (Screen Studio's speed adjustment)
- The progressive requirement loading is visually impressive — let it play

---

## SECTION 3 — THE DISCOVERY (1:00–1:50)

**This is the money section. Build toward the contradiction at 1:25.**

### LEFT SCREEN
**[KLING CLIP 5 — 5s]** Priya uploading documents confidently
**(1:00–1:15)** Then go full-right-screen to show document analysis
**[KLING CLIP 6 — 3s]** **(at 1:25)** Priya's expression shifts — concern
**(1:30–1:50)** Full-right-screen for advisory modal

### RIGHT SCREEN
- **1:00** — First document (passport) is drag-dropped onto "Valid Passport" requirement. Upload animates. Vision read begins — floating status bar appears at bottom: "Reading document... Passport (English)"
- **1:03** — Second document dropped. Remaining 7 documents auto-cascade with stagger animation. Floating bar updates: "Document 2 of 9... Document 3 of 9..." with live thinking excerpts.
- **1:08** — Documents analyzing in parallel. Requirement cards update progressively — green checkmarks for "met", amber warnings appearing. Advisory card updates in real-time.
- **1:15** — **THE MOMENT**: A requirement card turns red/critical. The floating bar shows thinking: *"Cross-referencing Hindi employment letter with English cover letter..."*
- **1:18** — Screen Studio zoom on the contradiction detail: Hindi employment letter says "स्थायी कर्मचारी" (permanent employee, ₹85,000/month). English cover letter says "contract consultant, ₹60,000/month."
- **1:25** — Second critical flag: conference invitation from easummit2026@gmail.com flagged as forensic issue.
- **1:30** — Phase 2 advisory refinement kicks in. Subtle loading indicator. Then the Advisory Modal opens: **"Let's Strengthen Your Application"**
- **1:35** — Modal content visible: Overall assessment "ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTS NEEDED", three prioritized fixes:
  1. CRITICAL — Cross-lingual contradiction (cover letter vs Hindi employment letter)
  2. CRITICAL — Gmail conference invitation (forensic flag)
  3. WARNING — 15-day trip for 3-day conference (narrative gap)
- **1:40** — Scroll slowly through the fix cards showing specific, actionable instructions
- **1:45** — Quick flash: the thinking panel expands on one requirement, showing Opus 4.6's actual reasoning in real-time

### VOICEOVER (deliver slowly, let the visuals land)
> *"Priya uploads her documents. Watch what happens."*

*(pause 3 seconds — let the cascade play)*

> *"Her employment letter — written in Hindi — says permanent employee at eighty-five thousand rupees. Her cover letter — in English — says contract consultant at sixty thousand. An embassy officer who reads Hindi would catch this instantly. Traverse catches it first."*

*(pause 1 second)*

> *"Three AI agents. Cross-lingual analysis. Specific fixes. In any language."*

### KLING AI PROMPTS

**Clip 5** — Priya uploading confidently (5s)
```
Medium shot of an Indian woman in her early 30s at her desk, 
confidently dragging files on her laptop trackpad. She has a slight 
smile — she thinks her documents are in order. Clean desk, organized 
documents beside the laptop. Warm indoor lighting, shallow DOF. She 
nods slightly to herself. Cinematic, 24fps.
```

**Clip 6** — Priya's expression shifts (3s)
```
Close-up of an Indian woman's face transitioning from mild confidence to 
subtle concern. Her eyes widen slightly, she leans forward toward the 
screen. Soft laptop glow on her face. This is a quiet moment of 
realization, not dramatic shock. Warm lighting, shallow DOF, cinematic 
film grain. Slow, subtle movement only.
```

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- The cross-lingual contradiction reveal at 1:15–1:25 is the emotional peak
- Use Screen Studio's zoom-on-click to punch in on the contradiction text
- **Speed up** the document analysis wait times (compress 30s of analysis into 10s of video)
- The advisory modal opening should feel like a payoff, not an interruption
- Consider a subtle sound effect (soft alert chime) when the critical flag appears

## SECTION 4 — THE FIX (1:50–2:25)

### LEFT SCREEN
**[KLING CLIP 7 — 5s]** Priya on phone, fixing documents
**[KLING CLIP 8 — 5s]** Priya looking relieved, organized desk
**(2:10 onward)** Full-right-screen for re-audit

### RIGHT SCREEN
- **1:50** — Inside advisory modal: click "Apply Fixes & Re-check"
- **1:53** — Re-audit begins. Fix cards show step pipeline: Fetching → Reading → Cross-checking → Verifying. Each fix processes sequentially.
- **1:58** — Fix 1 (cover letter): Pipeline animates through stages. Live thinking streams: *"Cross-checking against requirement..."* Green checkmark: "Verified — Cover letter matches Hindi employment letter."
- **2:03** — Fix 2 (conference invitation): Pipeline runs. Green checkmark: "Verified — Official domain, letterhead, registration number."
- **2:08** — Fix 3 (travel itinerary): Pipeline runs. Green checkmark: "Verified — Day-by-day itinerary accounts for all 15 days."
- **2:12** — All three fixes pass. Modal header updates to **"Looking Good!"** Overall assessment changes to **"APPLICATION PROCEEDS"**. Footer shows success state.
- **2:15** — Quick demo: click language selector globe icon in modal, switch to Hindi. The entire advisory translates with fade animation. *Namaste, Priya.*
- **2:20** — Close modal. Requirements page shows all green. Quick flash of switching back to English.

### VOICEOVER
> *"Priya fixes her documents. Traverse re-verifies each one — reading the corrected versions, cross-checking against every other document in her application."*

*(pause — let the green checkmarks land)*

> *"All three issues resolved. Application proceeds. And because Priya's mother tongue is Hindi — she can read every recommendation in her own language."*

### KLING AI PROMPTS

**Clip 7** — Priya fixing documents (5s)
```
Medium shot of an Indian woman at her desk, focused and productive. 
She's typing on her laptop with purpose and confidence. Documents are 
more neatly organized now. Maybe a phone beside her with a call log 
visible. Warm lighting, sense of progress and determination. Cinematic, 
shallow DOF.
```

**Clip 8** — Priya relieved (5s)
```
Medium close-up of an Indian woman leaning back slightly in her chair 
with a genuine, relieved smile. Her desk is now tidy — laptop open, 
documents in a neat folder. She looks satisfied, maybe does a small 
triumphant nod. Warm golden-hour-style lighting through a window. 
Cinematic, shallow DOF, film grain.
```

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- The re-audit pipeline is visually distinctive — each step lights up green
- Speed up the re-audit processing (compress ~45s into ~15s of video)
- The Hindi translation switch is a powerful "wow" moment — hold on it for 2-3 seconds
- The "Looking Good!" header change is the emotional resolution

---

## SECTION 5 — THE PAYOFF + CLOSE (2:25–2:50)

### LEFT SCREEN
**[KLING CLIP 9 — 6s]** Priya at airport, smiling with passport and boarding pass

### RIGHT SCREEN
- **2:25** — Quick montage (1s each): Amara Okafor (Nigeria → UK, Study) persona loading, Carlos Mendes (Brazil → Japan, Tourism) persona loading — just the corridor cards, showing the flags and corridors
- **2:30** — Back to Traverse landing page. The barrier-breaking text cycles through languages: English → Spanish → Arabic → Chinese → Hindi → French

### VOICEOVER
> *"Any corridor. Any language. From Bangalore to Berlin, Lagos to London, São Paulo to Tokyo. Thirty-seven thousand corridors. Forty languages. Zero immigration lawyers required."*

### KLING AI PROMPTS

**Clip 9** — Priya at airport (6s)
```
Cinematic shot of an Indian woman in her early 30s walking through a 
bright, modern airport terminal. She's pulling a carry-on suitcase, 
wearing a smart travel outfit (blazer, comfortable shoes). She holds her 
passport and a boarding pass in one hand, smiling naturally. Other 
travelers blur in the background. Natural daylight streams through large 
terminal windows. Slow-motion walk, 24fps cinematic, warm color grade. 
This is the emotional payoff — she made it.
```

### PRODUCTION NOTES
- The persona montage should be rapid cuts — just flags + names + corridors
- The airport clip is the emotional resolution — hold it, don't rush
- Music swells subtly here

---

## SECTION 6 — TITLE CARD (2:50–3:00)

### FULL SCREEN (merge left + right)

Clean title card sequence (CapCut text overlays):

> **Traverse**
> *Three AI agents that review your visa application*
> *like an experienced immigration team.*

Then smaller:

> **Built with Claude Opus 4.6**
> **Extended thinking · Web search · Vision · Multi-agent coordination**

Then:

> **Open source** · github.com/[repo-link]

Fade to black.

### VOICEOVER
*None. Music carries it out. Ambient resolves to silence.*

## KLING AI GENERATION SUMMARY

| # | Clip | Duration | Priority | Notes |
|---|------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Priya at desk with documents | 5s | HIGH | Sets the scene — must look natural |
| 2 | Close-up hands on passport + documents | 5s | HIGH | Shows the document problem visually |
| 3 | Priya at laptop, stressed | 5s | HIGH | Used twice (0:25 and 0:55) |
| 4 | Calendar showing "ESAS March 13–15" | 5s | MEDIUM | Could replace with a graphic if generation is poor |
| 5 | Priya uploading confidently | 5s | HIGH | Contrast with clip 6 — she thinks she's fine |
| 6 | Priya's expression shifts | 3s | CRITICAL | The emotional pivot. Must be subtle, not dramatic |
| 7 | Priya fixing documents | 5s | MEDIUM | Could be cut if time is tight |
| 8 | Priya relieved, organized desk | 5s | MEDIUM | Resolution beat |
| 9 | Priya at airport | 6s | HIGH | Emotional payoff — the final shot |

**Total clips**: 9 (44s of AI video)
**Fallback**: If any clip looks uncanny, replace with a text card or still frame. The app demo is the star.

## VOICEOVER SCRIPT (CONTINUOUS)

Copy this into ElevenLabs as one block. Use "Rachel" or "Adam" voice. Mark pauses with `...` (the reader will interpret these as natural beats).

```
This is Priya. She's a software engineer in Bangalore, attending her 
first tech conference in Berlin. She has nine documents — some in Hindi, 
some in English. She thinks they're ready... They're not.

Traverse's Research Agent searches live government sources — the German 
Federal Foreign Office, VFS Global — and builds a personalized checklist 
for Priya's exact corridor. Before she uploads a single document, it 
already knows what she needs.

Priya uploads her documents... Watch what happens.

...

Her employment letter — written in Hindi — says permanent employee at 
eighty-five thousand rupees. Her cover letter — in English — says 
contract consultant at sixty thousand. An embassy officer who reads 
Hindi would catch this instantly... Traverse catches it first.

Three AI agents. Cross-lingual analysis. Specific fixes. In any 
language.

Priya fixes her documents. Traverse re-verifies each one — reading the 
corrected versions, cross-checking against every other document in her 
application.

...

All three issues resolved. Application proceeds. And because Priya's 
mother tongue is Hindi — she can read every recommendation in her own 
language.

Any corridor. Any language. From Bangalore to Berlin, Lagos to London, 
São Paulo to Tokyo. Thirty-seven thousand corridors. Forty languages. 
Zero immigration lawyers required.
```

**Estimated read time**: ~95 seconds of voiceover out of 170 seconds total. The remaining 75 seconds are visual breathing room (music only).

## JUDGING CRITERIA ALIGNMENT

| Criteria | Weight | How This Demo Hits It |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Demo** | 30% | Split-screen storytelling, emotional arc, Priya's journey from stress → resolution → airport. Visually polished. |
| **Impact** | 25% | 1.5B visa applicants/year. Cross-lingual detection catches errors humans miss. Breaks language barrier. Problem Statement 2: "Break the Barriers." |
| **Opus 4.6 Use** | 25% | Extended thinking (visible in UI), web search (research agent), vision (document reading), multi-agent coordination, cross-lingual reasoning. All shown live, not mocked. |
| **Depth & Execution** | 20% | Two-phase advisory, in-modal re-audit, 40-language i18n, three demo personas, progressive SSE streaming, privacy-first architecture. Not a weekend hack — real engineering. |

## CRITICAL PRODUCTION RULES

1. **The app is the star.** Kling clips support the story, they don't lead it. If any clip looks off, cut it. A clean app demo with text cards is better than a polished app demo with one bad AI clip.

2. **The contradiction at 1:15 is everything.** Every other moment builds toward it or pays off from it. Don't rush it. Let the voiceover land, let the screen zoom hit.

3. **Speed up wait times, never skip them.** The analysis pipeline takes 30-60 seconds in real time. Speed it to 10-15 seconds in video. The viewer needs to see it working, but they don't need to wait.

4. **End on emotion, not features.** The airport shot is the last image before the title card. Not a screenshot, not a feature list. A person who got to take their trip.

5. **Under 3 minutes is non-negotiable.** The hackathon cap is 3:00. If you're at 2:55, cut a Kling clip. If you're at 3:05, cut the persona montage. Protect the core arc: Priya's problem → discovery → fix → success.

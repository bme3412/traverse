        </div>

        <div class="salutation">
            Dear Sir/Madam,
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
            <p>
                I am writing to apply for a Schengen Business Visa to attend the <strong>European Software Architecture Summit 2026</strong>, which will be held in Berlin, Germany from March 13-15, 2026. I am planning to travel to Germany from <strong>March 10, 2026 to March 25, 2026</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am a <strong>Senior Software Engineer employed on a permanent, full-time basis</strong> with NovaTech Solutions Pvt. Ltd., a Mumbai-based technology company. I have been associated with the company since March 1, 2020, specializing in enterprise software architecture and cloud-based solutions. My current monthly gross salary is <strong>₹85,000 per month</strong> (₹10,20,000 annually).
            </p>

            <p>
                This conference is crucial for my professional development as it brings together leading software architects and technology experts from across Europe and Asia. The summit will feature keynote sessions on emerging architectural patterns, microservices, and cloud-native development - all areas directly relevant to my work. Attending this event will enhance my technical skills and enable me to bring valuable insights back to my team in India.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been formally invited to attend this conference by the organizing committee. The invitation letter is enclosed with this application. The conference registration fee of €450 has been paid, and I have received confirmation of my attendance.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have made the following arrangements for my trip:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 18px;">
                <li>Round-trip flight bookings with confirmed reservations (March 10-25, 2026)</li>
                <li>Hotel accommodation in Berlin for the entire duration of my stay</li>
                <li>Travel insurance covering the full period of travel with minimum €30,000 coverage</li>
                <li>Sufficient financial means to support myself during the trip</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The extended duration of my trip (15 days total) allows me to attend the 3-day conference (March 13-15) as well as engage in professional networking opportunities, visit technology companies in Berlin, and explore cultural sites during the weekend periods. A detailed day-by-day itinerary is enclosed with this application.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have strong ties to India, including my permanent employment with NovaTech Solutions, family commitments, and property in Mumbai. My employer has granted me approved leave for this period and confirmed that my position will be retained upon my return. I have no intention of overstaying my visa or seeking employment in Germany. I will return to India immediately after the conclusion of my trip to resume my professional duties.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have enclosed all required documents with this application, including my passport, employment certificate, bank statements for the past six months, income tax returns, flight bookings, hotel reservations, conference invitation, travel insurance policy, and detailed travel itinerary.
            </p>

            <p>
                I kindly request you to grant me a Schengen Business Visa for the duration of my planned stay. I assure you that I will abide by all German and Schengen visa regulations and will depart from Germany before my visa expires.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for considering my application. I am available for an interview at your convenience if required. Please feel free to contact me if you need any additional information or clarification.
            </p>
